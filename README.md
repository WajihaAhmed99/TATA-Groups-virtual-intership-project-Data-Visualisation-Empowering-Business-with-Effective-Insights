# TATA-Groups-virtual-intership-project-Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights
This Virtual internship is about gaining  insights into leveraging data visualisations as a tool for making informed business decisions.
## About the Project
In this virtual internship, as a consultant for an online retail store, I ensured data quality, made changes in Excel, analyzed revenue factors enabling strategic planning for the upcoming year using Tableau, and presented key findings in PowerPoint.
## Tools use in this project
* 1.Excel for Data Analysis and Data Transformation
* 2.Tableau for Data Visulization
* 3.Power Point for Data Presentation
## Datasets used in this project
In this project we use single dataset provided by TATA Online retail store.
* Online Retail
## Data Cleaning & Transformation
Although it is company own data so their is no such big data quality issues with data but we need little bit transformation.
#### Data Quality
* In **quantity** column their is negative values so we remove that by using ABS function to get absolute value .
** =ABS(Quantity)
* In **Unit price** column their is values which is less than 0 so we handle it by using SUMIF formating.
#### Data Transformation
* we create revenue column by multiplying quantity and unit price column . 
** revenue = quantity* unit price
#### Data types
We change data type of **Revenue** and **Unit price** datatype into **currency**.
## Data Analysis
We represent our key findings in form of Power point reprsesntation which is shown in files. We also represent our finding in the form of Tableau Dashboad .Here is link of Dashboard.
